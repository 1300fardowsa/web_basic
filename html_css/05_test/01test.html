    <h1>basic html animal 1</h1>

    <p>is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>
    <h2>the l1ama 2</h2>


<p>Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her
    lips as she goes.</p>

    <h2>the anaconda</h2>

    <p>The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his
        prey.</p>
